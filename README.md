The projects title is ”Design and development of an digital assessment systems for
virtual examination” in which we are trying to produce a solution for modern problem,
as the world is moving towards the automation and digital age, so there is a need
of automation in the Indian examination system as well. The current pandemic has
raised many questions, has shown how badly Indian educational institutions’ is lacking
in creating fair environment for student and teachers as well. Major problem is to get
a fair platform to automatically generate question from a given syllabus, and checking
of answers require a high concentration, time, and, energy which has increased work
load of teachers immensely and are prone to mistakes as well. Hence there is a need
for automatic system which can generate questions, check the answers and, generate
the performance. Also, managing a huge database of question-answer systems and
different unfair means like paper-leakage, and generating different sets of questions is
a major concern. In the manual system, it may be possible that different marks are
given for the same answer. Solving all these problems, this system can lead to more
efficient, fair, and, smooth conduction of examination.
